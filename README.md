# Maui Roulette Wheel
 A roulette wheel created in Dotnet Maui, creating a fun way to select an item from a list of items
# DOES NOT WORK ON WINDOWS 
 The wheel uses a ClipPath to give the illusion of invidivual sectors, which Windows doesn't support. The sectors are actually triangles extending beyond the wheel, and being clipped so only the part in the wheel is visible. You could fix this yourself by removing the ClipPath, but the wheel will not look as it is intended.
